Mysql pagers
============

### Problem ###

When working with lots of data, the mysql console can become quite a jungle of characters.

### Solution ###

Mysql pagers.

### How it works ###

People who are familiar with the shell know about piping (eg. `ls -la | more`).
Well, it seems that a mysql-pager is basically a pipe, which allows you to do something with all the textdata.

### Commands ###

  * activate pagers: `pager more` or `pager vim -`
  * deactivate: `nopager`

### Demo ###
