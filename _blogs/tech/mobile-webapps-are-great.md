### Statement ###

*Developing native apps which are only informative is usually a waste of money*

### What are native apps ###

Native apps are apps made for a particular platform (as in `android` or `iOS`).
They need a particular programmer which has experience with that particular platform.

### Benefits native apps ###

  * great for on-the-edge technology
  * fastest computing speed

### What are informative apps? ###

Apps which just do basic stuff like displaying information, pictures, sounds and video.

### What are webapps? ###

Webapps are basically HTML5/Webkit-applications which are supported by all major smartphone/tabletdevices.

### Advantages of webapps over native apps ###

  * write once, run on all platforms (android/iphone/tablet/younameit)
  * need no approval from third parties (`appstore etc`)
  * therefore transparent deadlines
  * therefore faster developmenttime than native apps


### Authors experience ###

I did several projects, and I'm quite enthousiast about this webapps-movement.
Eventhough its pretty new, I already had quite some satisfied customers.

### Why do I think its the bomb? ###

  * runs on ALL mobile platforms (iphone/android/etc)
  * faster development then native apps
  * your app is never going to be rejected by applestore, this happens very often
  * more control regarding deadlines
  * faster development, you can update without getting approval
  * cheaper then native app (which starts around 15.000$)
  * step by step marketing: first webapp, then maybe app later

### You have been warned ###

As you might have noticed, webapps are <b>NOT</b> native apps, and are <b>NOT</b> submitted to any (apple) store.
Because of that, you have to consider the following things:

  * needs extra packaging to submit to (apple)store (if this is part of your business plan)
  * partially support for specific phone-features (soon camera/3d hardwareacceleration will come though)

Other then that, its the next step since the applestore's restrictions are getting more and more strict (because of the growing amount of apps).

### Conclusion ###

Mobile webapps is what you should look for in the 1st place nowadays!
