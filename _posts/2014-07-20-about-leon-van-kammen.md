title: About me 
---

I like to ride [heelys](http://www.heelys.com) for transportation, talk about opensource technology, 
and love creating electronic music.

I started out as a dutch softwareengineer after getting my Bachelor degree in Computer Science. 
After an awesome startup-experience, I became an independent devtrepeneur.
Becoming independent was scary, but one of the best decisions of my life.
Technology allows individuals to accomplish amazing things which do not necessarily require managers,offices etc (a startup).

Thats why I see myself as a micropreneur, bootstrapper, soloSaaS (you name it).

# Contact me

I'm happy to receive mail, so you can contact me at info@leon.vankammen.eu for business- or techrelated topics.

* 'psychology of computer programming' (Gerald M. Weinberg)
* 'getting real' (37 signals)
* 'the mythical man month' (Fred Brooks)
* 'Yoga Sutras' (Patanjali)

# Vision on software development

Inmho there are 2 ways of making software: the correct way, and the incorrect way, and both of them are wrong.
In the end it boils down to transparency, playfullness, non-attachment to code or design, KISS (KeepItSimpleStupid), and keeping iterations real by using MoSCoW.
I have met and followed many engineers, architects and hobbyist developers.
My conclusion is that many things can be done in many ways: with/without planning, with/without fancy methodology XYZ.
In the end my favourite model is the 'Chaos model' since its one of the few models which promotes non-linear progress. 

# Real-world achievements

In the past I was responsible for setting up an physical office for a developerteam. In parallel I was setting up a cloud office (private chat/issuetracker/pastesystem/GIT infrastructure/server infrastructure/continues deployment, testing and documentation). 

I was also responsible for interviewing and hiring back- and frontend developers, architect of software projects, reviewing of code, license-compatibility research, devops, lead programmer of REST- and/or API integrations.

# Cloud environments

Google App Engine, AWS, Rackspace, New relic, papertrail, Heroku, OpenShift, Appfog, cloud9, github, bitbucket, issuetrackers, HAL, basecamp.

# Past Projects keywords

Integration, PaaS, SaaS, BaaS, Opensource, RESTful API, integration, aggregation, webpipes, service bus, docker, backend, hooks fanatic, longrunning jobs, syslog logging.

# methodologies

Distributed (sys)logging setups & alerting. 
continuous testing, continuous deployment, continuous documentation, ZenCoding, Dutch Government-compliant websites (not easy!),
fully automated deployment/unittesting, black- white- and grayboxtesting. 

* Rapid Application development
* Extreme programming
* Chaos model
* Waterfall

But also Agile, Scrum, RUP, Spiral- and V-model when budgets are sufficient.
And last but not least the 'forget-models-we-have-a-deadline'-model :)
