  Hi! In this post I'm playing with the some ideas concerning open API specs vs Patent/Intellectual Property.
  
</div>

# Why?

We are entering an ERA which introduces a businessmind vs techmind schizofrenia syndrome.
Open API specifications (swaggerspec/raml/wsdl/jsonschema/etc) are becoming vital for others to embrace cloud services.

# Do people care?

Privacy soldiers, Security fanatics, API fanatics and Free/Opensource are pushing this open specs forward.
Their impact is quite big these days.

# How does the traditional businesman(ager) deal with this?

Here's the struggle.
Fundamental building blocks of technological progress are transparency, understanding, and acceptance.
But if we're going to publish everything out there in the future, what will the aftermath look like?
Will companies only push fully opensource API's to see the market response?
Will it become a humanright to use certain API's for free?

# My conclusion: business likely to lose

> I'm not sure whether patents will dig its own grave in the future.
> But I do feel that technological progress seems to move exponentially.
> A webproduct is launched, and the next month a kid from russia published
> his 'clone' on a opensource repository website.
> I wouldnt be surprised seeing proprietary software not being able to 
> catch up with open technology.
