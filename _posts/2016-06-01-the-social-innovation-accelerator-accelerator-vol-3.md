title: Social Innovation licenses to accelerate trust (the social innovation accelerator accelerator vol3) 
---

<div class="message">
  Hi! In this post I will share my thoughts on how the corporate- and social innovation-world can learn from opensource.
  It tries to answer the question: *"How to design an bottom-up selfaccelerating SI accelerator, like a fractal"*
</div>

Terminology:

* OPENSOURCE: tools and products which both business- and non-businessworld can use & modify
* SIC: social innovative concept
* RESTAPI: popular way to distribute and share online data
* BOTTOM-UP: Team members are invited to participate in every step of the management process

The above illustrated cyclic flow (or parts of it) could happen thru human interaction, or software.

## Business vs non-business

The softwareworld has shown that opensource benefits both business- and non-business world.
A possible explanation could be the use of licenses.
The SI-world could be streamlined similarly, if it would simply apply 2 types of licenses to SIC's:

# license 1: SIVP (viral permissive)

Examples:

* AGPL / GPL license
* Creative commons license
 
All SIC's derived from a SIC with a viral permissive license, would automatically become virally permissive.
A VPL basically means: everything will be- and stay in the public domain.
Everybody in the SI domain can read, re-use data of SIC's.
One could argue that people could abuse/ignore this license, but in reality (the softwareworld) this would be too  embarrassing.

## license 2: SISP (semi-permissive license)

Examples:

* LGPL license

This license would allow companies to monetize on another SIC.
There are many cases why SI participants would want to use an SPL license:

* boost the exposure of their SIC
* monetize on supporting the companies

## Why it works

One can't turn license 1 into 2 and vice versa. Therefore every good idea will have an open and closed version (think androidphones and apple phones).
Example:

* SIC A starts with SIVP license 
* therefore SIC B & C will automatically be SIVP 
* Business X will not monetize on SIC A, because Business Y can do the same (since SIC A is in the public domain)
* Business Y __could__ monetize on SIC A+B+C, because the combination could result in a unique service/product 

Whatever business is going to monetize on a SIVP-licensed SIC, it has to keep its data/modifications available to the public domain.

Another one:

* SIC T starts with SISP license 
* Business X can immediately modify, build & monetize upon on SIC T 
* Business X is not required to share its modifications/improvements of SIC T
