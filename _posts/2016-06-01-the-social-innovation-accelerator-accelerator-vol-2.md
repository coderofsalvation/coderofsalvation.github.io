title: Healthy & Recyclable Social Innovation (the social innovation accelerator accelerator vol2)

<div class="message">
  Hi! In this post I will share my thoughts on how the corporate- and social innovation-world can learn from opensource.
  It tries to answer the question: *"How to design an bottom-up selfaccelerating SI accelerator, like a fractal"*

> Terminology
> * OPENSOURCE: tools and products which both business- and non-businessworld can use & modify
> * SIC: social innovative concept
> * RESTAPI: popular way to distribute and share online data
> * BOTTOM-UP: Team members are invited to participate in every step of the management process

The above illustrated cyclic flow (or parts of it) could happen thru human interaction, or software.
Therefore, a house with people could also simply represent a database.

## SIC healthcare

Ideally a healthy SIC would need at least 2 participants to prevent dictatorship or hierarchy.

In softwareworld, dictatorship is allowed but in practice only works for very small projects/components.
As the participants (Developers) grow, the dictator will get flooded with communication & todos.
Eventually the dictator becomes unresponsive and/or abandons the project and/or will team up with another participants or projects.
The dictator-experience is an experience every opensource software developer needs to experience.
One would almost think that, in order to prevent dictatorship, everybody should be allowed to try to be a dictator.

## Participants as a currency/metric

When __participants__ of SIC's get an equal personal budget (time or money), SI is accelerated democratically. Each participant can decide on his/her own to either reinvent the wheel, or join similar minded SIC's.
Lets not dream away on how this would beautifully fit into a [European base income-concept](http://basicincome-europe.org/ubie).

## End of projects

> Stop top-down projects, start bottom-up SIC's.

As much as we love to believe governments can support SI, a government has traditionally been a top-down apparatus.
One could argue true top-down does not really exists, since in the end it always boils down to a network of people.
However, budgets mostly get distributed top-down over groups of people, and for SIC's this works counterproductive.

> SI budgets should be spreaded over participants for a bottom-up workflow, and acceleration of trust.

## From Temporary to Durable innovation

* projects have an start and end
* but SIC's have activity

## SIC's should be clusterable 

* projects are seperated by time/budgets
* but SIC's can cluster and/or recycle eachother regardless of time (see picture)

As you can see, a topology of open SIC's will fully be able to re-use eachothers efforts.
Projects however, can only re-use published data.
See in the next article how licenses can accelerate trust.

Focusing on milestones instead of measuring elapsed time:

* projects measure progress in time
* but SIC's could just focus on 'its done when its done'

> NOTE: It's not a bad idea to use projects at all. Governments & people can still benefit a lot from projects. However, governments should be 
careful when to use projects or SIC's. If you only got one hammer, everything becomes a nail.
