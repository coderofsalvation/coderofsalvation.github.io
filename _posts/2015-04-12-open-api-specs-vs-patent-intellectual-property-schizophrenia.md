  Hi! In this post I'm playing with the some ideas concerning open API specs vs Patent/Intellectual Property.
  
</div>

# Why?

We are entering an ERA which introduces a businessmind vs techmind schizofrenia syndrome.
Open API specifications (swaggerspec/raml/wsdl/jsonschema/etc) are a vital resource for companies adopting eachothers technology. 

This is great, but hold on, wasn't the traditional business about protecting one's intellectual property? 

# Who are pushing open specs?

Companies, Privacy soldiers, Security fanatics, API fanatics and Free/Opensource are pushing this open specs forward. Their impact is quite big these days.

# How does the traditional businesman(ager) deal with this?

Here's the struggle.
There's something about tech which pushes transparency forward.
Transparency to understand and accept, adopt and to tweak.

In the last years I see more companies seeing the benefit of making their API's highly adoptable thru transparent  api spec-standards (mentioned above).

But if we're going to publish everything out there in the future, what will the aftermath look like?

# The good thing about open api specs, is that you can generate api's from it..or not?

One could argue that the apidesign itself doesn't need protection, and that its code, databasecontent and users is of higher importance.

However, in my (humble) experience I have always found the design of an API is of higher value than code.
Your team cannot beat an flawed api design with adding more spaghetti, it will sink the ship eventually.

# Future 

If connectivity is the key these days, the word `api development` might become something like 'serial cable' over time.
Will the api-developers of today swap their tools for an enterprise account where they can drag-drop blocks and build integrations?

# My (odd) conclusion: business likely to lose

`Disclaimer: usually my opinion changes over time ;)`
