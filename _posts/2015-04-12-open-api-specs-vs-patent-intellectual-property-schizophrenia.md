  Hi! In this post I'm playing with the some ideas concerning open API specs vs Patent/Intellectual Property.
  
</div>

# Why?

We are entering an ERA which introduces a businessmind vs techmind schizofrenia syndrome.
Open API specifications (swaggerspec/raml/wsdl/jsonschema/etc) are a vital resource for companies adopting eachothers technology. 

This is great, but hold on, wasn't the traditional business about protecting one's intellectual property? 

# Who are pushing open specs?

Companies, Privacy soldiers, Security fanatics, API fanatics and Free/Opensource are pushing this open specs forward. Their impact is quite big these days.

# How does the traditional businesman(ager) deal with this?

Here's the struggle.
There's something about tech which pushes transparency forward.
Transparency to understand and accept, adopt and to tweak.

In the last years I see more companies making their API's highly adoptable by pushing transparent api spec-standards (mentioned above).

# The good thing about open api specs, is that you can generate api's from it..or not?

One could argue that the apidesign itself isnt IP worthy, and that its code, databasecontent and users is of higher importance.
But is this really true?

The weird thing is that most software is already been written by software.
So if we're generating the software by combining previously generated software..who's writing it?
I guess businesses have to look in other ways to protect their business.

So publishing the api design (and its spec format) is another step into this direction.
Who knows we'll end up with a 'Borg'-apicompany (`startrek pun`), which assimilates all API-specs out there, to build the ultimate API.

# Future 

If connectivity is the key, the word `api development` might become something like 'serial cable' over time.
Maybe the api-developers of today, will be called wire-developers.
They just login to some enterprise account, where they drag wires from one block to another block.
Bugs are nearly non-existent since the quantum laptop already simulated the software for billions of multiverses.

# My (odd) conclusion: business likely to lose

`Disclaimer: usually my opinion changes over time ;)`
