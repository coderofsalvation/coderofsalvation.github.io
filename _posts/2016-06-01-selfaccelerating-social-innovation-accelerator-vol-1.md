title: Selfaccelerating social innovation like a fractal (selfaccelerating social innovation accelerator vol1)
---

<div class="message">
  Hi! In this ramble I will share my thoughts on, how the corporate- and social innovation-world could be shaped, using softwareworld-practices.
  I tried to answer the question: *"How to design an bottom-up selfaccelerating SI accelerator, like a fractal"*, without having 
  in-depth knowledge about SI at all :)

Terminology:

* __OPENSOURCE__: tools and products which both business- and non-businessworld can use & modify
* __SIC__: social innovative concept
* __RESTAPI__: popular way to distribute and share online data
* __BOTTOM-UP__: Team members are invited to participate in every step of the management process

The above illustrated cyclic flow (or parts of it) could happen thru human interaction and/or software.
Therefore, a house with people could also simply represent a database.

## Example: the software world

The above is not fantasy, it is actually how the current software world works already.
A beautiful way to allow hobbyists and corporate world to sculpt & share tools.

When SI accelerators would use the cyclic models, everybody would win.
Both business and non-business-world would benefit from good SIC's.

## But computers are cool..

> Yes, sometimes. 

As the volume of SIC's grows, software __could__ be needed at some point to search- and link SIC's to eachother.
And if you do, you want the data to be online, and accessible by other accelerators using an RESTAPI or similar protocol.

## An SI accelerator accelerator

An SI accelerator ideally should accelerate itself.
Therefore, its output should flow back into its input.
This would prevent the yet-another-social-innovative-concept (__YASIC__) syndrome.
The YASIC syndrome is a great way to waste money, time and resources.
The YASIC syndrome happens because of the following reasons:

* lack of sharing between IC's (and their accelerators)
* budgets being linked to SIC's or accelerators, instead of the actual participants
* accelerator treating SIC as a temporary project
* accelerator does not feed-back into other accelerators (becomes a leave of a tree)
