---

My name is Leon van Kammen, I was originally born in the beautiful [Stadskanaal](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Stadskanaal,+Netherlands/@50.5653345,6.6503423,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c83bb57e3000c9:0xb8497bdac29f4022?hl=en) in Groningen/NL.<br>
> I'm a european DEVTREPENEUR: developer by heart, entrepeneur in mind: keep things simple and functional.  
After graduating as a softwareengineer, I worked in IT, went freelance / entrepeneurial but never left my love for hacking.
I love to work with people who are passionate about api integration, open source, SaaS, BaaS, PaaS-tech.

## Other achievements 

* I can do a cool trick with a cup of coffee and a spoon

## My take on software creation

Transparency, playfullness, non-attachment to code or design, KISS (KeepItSimpleStupid), and keeping iterations small using [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method).<br>
My favourite model is the [Chaos model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_model) since its one of the few models which promotes non-linear progress. 
I also like building processes around [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) when SCRUM causes too much overhead.

## Favorite books

* 'psychology of computer programming' (Gerald M. Weinberg)
* 'getting real' (37 signals)
* 'the mythical man month' (Fred Brooks)
* 'Yoga Sutras' (Patanjali)

## Opensource contributions
