title: About me
---

My name is Leon van Kammen, I was originally born in the beautiful [Stadskanaal](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Stadskanaal,+Netherlands/@50.5653345,6.6503423,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c83bb57e3000c9:0xb8497bdac29f4022?hl=en) in Groningen/NL.<br>
After graduating I started out as a softwareengineer, and nowadays I love work with people on api/opensource/SaaS/BaaS/PaaS-technology.
I'm a european DEVTREPENEUR: developer by heart, entrepeneur in mind, running independent projects.

## My take on software creation

There are 3 ways of making software: the correct way, and the incorrect way, and the succesful way.<br>
In the end it boils down to transparency, playfullness, non-attachment to code or design, KISS (KeepItSimpleStupid), and keeping iterations real by using [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method).<br>
My favourite model is the [Chaos model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_model) since its one of the few models which promotes non-linear progress. A methodology which also does this well is [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)

## Favorite books

* 'psychology of computer programming' (Gerald M. Weinberg)
* 'getting real' (37 signals)
* 'the mythical man month' (Fred Brooks)
* 'Yoga Sutras' (Patanjali)
