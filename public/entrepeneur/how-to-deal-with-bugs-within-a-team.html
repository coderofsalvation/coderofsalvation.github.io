<h3>The issue </h3>
<p>In <a href="/blog/how-to-not-become-a-reliability-engineer-for-every-project">my previous article</a> I explained some aspects which can keep you focused on creative aspects of a project. However, this article will go more into details on how to design software which deal with errors for different environments/teams/servers.</p>
<h3>Some rules for your developers </h3>
<ol>
<li>
create a global logfunction (macro) and a plugin/module-related one (micro)
</li><li>
each logcall can be of type: development, notice, warning, (soft) error
</li><li>
buffer all logcalls in one array.
</li><li>
upon error you write the full logbuffer into a new file (instead of appending)
</li><li>
a soft error is an error, but it should not break execution
</li><li>
notify hard errors (email/sms etc)
</li><li>
<em>never</em> <em>never</em> print errors/uncaught exceptions to stdout
</li><li>
write a close() function for your framework which is the only allowed function to call die() / exit() e.g.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that you create different behaviours for different servers in a flexible way. This sounds like managing BS but this can simply be done by a one configuration file per server.</p>
<h3>Dev server </h3>
<p>Important is that we see everything in the global+pluginlogs right away on the devserver:</p>

<h3>Staging server </h3>
<p>Lets not go into emailing here yet..</p>

<h3>Live server </h3>
<p>Here lets go into emailing + sms (make sure you throttle calls in a human way). Maximum one email + sms per hour on workdays and 1 per 3 hours during the weekend will be ok.</p>

<h3>Then, if everything is set.. ###  </h3>
<p>Relax and enjoy! The key is to have this environment setup from the start.</p>
