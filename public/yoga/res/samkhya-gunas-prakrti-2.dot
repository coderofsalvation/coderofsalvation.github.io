  label="\nEnergy in Yoga is made of 3 components (gunas) like RGB-colors, but with a slight difference.\nTheir values vary between : negative, balanced, positive (fictional range [-1,0,1]).\nDocumentation of this model (Samkhya) was found many years before 200 CE.\nIt does not claim to be some sort atomic pluralism as the ultimate theory of the origin of the world.\nBut, as a partial declaration of the Vedic Sciences,\n and cut short the process of resolution at the ordinary Atoms of Matter.\n The theory adresses itself to a class of students who do were not educated for the latter.\n\nhttp://leon.vankammen.eu/yoga"
