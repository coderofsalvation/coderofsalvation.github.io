Korg Electribe SX Upgrade Memory Channels ESX
=============================================

`UPDATE: now with temporary discount`

If you have been annoyed with the limitations of the Electribe SX: `you came to the right place`.

### The Problem ###

The Electribe SX has limited memory, which is a bummer since resampling is one of the most powerful features.
Also, it has only max 12 playback channels, so it's impossible to play more than 12 channels.
Well not anymore..

### The Solution ###

I'm [selling](https://gumroad.com/l/pBHE/social) a special .ESX-file which upgrades your Electribe SX with the following:

* template / boilerplate for livesets
* optimized for low memory consumption (85% free memory, perfect for livesets)
* 272 samples but they occupy only 4 sample-slots (=252 free sample-slots)
* extra playback channels: 128 samples per channel (using startpoint-parameter)
* 256 (mostly drum) samples from Korg Electribe SX and MX
* 16 oscillators
* custom lowlevel file-modifications which allows longer pingpongloops

### For who ###

* people who want to build a full-liveset-in-one-ESX-file
* people who want lean-and-mean drumkits
* people who want to make music using another ESX workflow
* people who want more (66%) free samplememory compared to the factory ESX-file
* people want to play more samples at the same time
* people have lots of memory for additional (re)sampling as a startingpoint
