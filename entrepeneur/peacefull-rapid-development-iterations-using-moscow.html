<h3>Quote </h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you don't plan to achieve rapid development, you can't expect to achieve it.</em></p>
<p>&#8212; quote by <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/rdenum.htm">Steve Mcconnel</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What is RAD </h3>
<p>Rapid application development (R.A.D) is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. </p>
<h3>The reality </h3>
<p>Everybody agrees with <strong>Rapid Development</strong> and <strong>planning stuff</strong>. But it can be tempting for developers &amp; managers to think like : <em>"Hey if we forget about planning stuff, we  can do more <strong>rapid development</strong>!"</em>. When dealing with serious projects, this is a myth imho.</p>
<h3>Side Product: Confusion on time </h3>
<p><em>Planningless</em> RAD might be ok for a while, but at some point, as the project becomes more and more succesfull, soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
more and more features need to be implemented.
</li><li>
the developers will realize its too risky to deploy/upgrade productioncode every day.
</li><li>
the developers realize, that they dont feel confident about the software.
</li><li>
more and more the focus will have to go to testing and riskmanagement
</li><li>
the staff experiences an unhealthy bugs/feature-ratio
</li><li>
the idea of <em>lets plan!</em> gets easily rejected "<em>because we always worked like this from the start</em>"
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, without planning, nobody knows anymore what can be done succesfully in any given timeframe.</p>
<h3>Side Product: Hypnosis </h3>
<p>It became too big, the RAD-methology starts too work against the team. If the team is ignorant about this, usually the negative effects are 'solved' using a traditional counterproductive method:  hypnotising/manipulating eachothers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Manager to Developer-hypnosis on the last day before update: <code>can you pleeease also do feature x before tomorrow?</code>
</li><li>
Manager to Developer-hypnosis: <code>Why is feature y in the next update, and x is not?</code>
</li><li>
Developer to Manager-hypnosis: <code>Look its RAD ok..we agreed on not planning stuff to get feature z in this upgrade</code>
</li><li>
Manager to Developer-hypnosis: <code>Its always a mystery what will be in the next release</code>
</li><li>
Developer to Manager-hypnosis: <code>I can add the small logo..but it will take me 5 days to test all platforms</code>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Longterm RAD Project results </h3>
<ul>
<li>
Having the illusion that RAD will give turbo to your project
</li><li>
Starting off with highquality planning-ethos, and ending up with none
</li><li>
Stockholder x is not happy because his proposed feature isnt in the update 
</li><li>
Code-smell: hairy code will control the developers instead of vice versa
</li><li>
Worstcase: people will start pointing fingers to one another
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why </h3>
<p>RAD doesnt really force people to say- or expect a 'no' during upgrades. Development needs a 'no' sometimes, and usually good programmers can say 'no'. Approved Feature/BugFix-requests usually get associated with 'promises' (a <em>yes</em>), this is a big danger. The IT catchphrase <em>The sky is the limit</em>, should be rephrased in this case to <em>The 'yes' is the limit</em>.</p>
<h3>Solution: Keep it RAD and real </h3>
<p>So how to go from RAD to Planned RAD? I've tried many software development metholodies, but throughout the years I've found this particular combination very powerfull:</p>
<ul>
<li>
RAD
</li><li>
MoSCoW
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is MoSCoW </h3>
<p>The MoSCoW-method is a priority-system in future software development iterations (updates). If you would ask me, I would call it "keeping things real" between the staff/devteam/stakeholders. MoSCoW kills false expectations, because every approved feature- or bugfix-request is categorized democratically like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
M - must haves   (must be in the next upgrade)
</li><li>
S - should haves (very wanted functionality, but upgrade is usable without them)
</li><li>
C - could haves  (if there's enough time)
</li><li>
W - won't haves  (not included, but maybe in the future some day)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Approved Feature/BugFix-requests usually get associated with 'promises', this is a big danger.</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"The more heads, the more thoughts"</strong></p>
<p>This is a dutch expression, and it means that brainstorming can work counterproductive. A good startingpoint would be to let the leaddevelopers and CTO or one stakeholder take care of the 'end round' concerning this democratic process. More than 3 persons might introduce endless brainstorms. Make sure every employee has the opportunity to vote for a feature/issue. This will stop manipulation between collegues to push his/her agenda forward. A more strict approach would be the asian Kanban-method in which the developmentteam always reports an x amount of free slots for new issues/features.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Possible examples </h3>
<p>Ok, assuming that you somehow manage/log your features/bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
in an issue/bugtracker
</li><li>
a spreadsheet
</li><li>
a whiteboard
</li><li>
a kanban-style interface
</li><li>
in todo.txt 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to implement?</h3>
<p>Bugtracker-users can add a 'M','S','C' or 'W' to their ticket-titles. Or even better, a 'MoSCoW'-field to each ticket, it could look like this: &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>MoSCoW</strong>: <select style="width:5.0em">     <option value="">M</option>     <option value="">S</option>     <option value="">C</option>     <option value="">W</option>   </select></p>
<p>Or, in case of a spreadsheet/textfile (personal projects eg.), here's what to do..suppose you have this list:</p>
<code><pre>
1. [bug] fonts are too big on platform x, need size 12
2. [feature] data needs to automatically do y
3. [feature] data needs to automatically do y
</pre></code>
<p>If you communicate this to your staff/collegues, you could also do it like this:</p>
<code><pre>

M. [bug] fonts are too big on platform x, need size 12
C. [feature] data needs to automatically do y
S. [feature] data needs to automatically do y
</pre></code>
<p>This is just an example, but it can be very powerfull as soon as you start using it right.</p>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>RAD is great in certain situations, but if the software needs to be well managed, you better plan stuff. I have no idea if I understood Steve Mcconnel's quote correctly, but in the above describe scenario he's right. I also hope that I inspired many people with this. Whether you are a (freelance) programmer, devteam, managementteam or stockholder: MoSCoW can be very effective. I wish i had a timemachine; could go back in time; and hand over this article to myself..it would be such a productivity-booster!</p>
<h3>Further Reading </h3>
<p>I think Steve Mcconnel probably has observed many different outcomes for many different projects, and that many people can learn from him. You probably want to read his <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/rdenum.htm">website</a>. He has many great advices which address many pittfalls for developmentteams. How could one ignore such free knowledge?</p>
