<h1>Should SaaS use SaaS?</h1>
<h3>Quote </h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The day of hiring techguys to make your software is over, nowadays everything happens in the cloud man. Why would every company need a developmentteam to build the same boring systems. These systems can be made once, and used by all against a friendly fee. Stop messing with opensource hobbyist stuff, just pay to receive a rocksolid service and dont worry anymore</em></p>

<h3>Why isnt this always true </h3>
<ul>
<li>
More standardization in softwaremaking occured thruout the years
</li><li>
It can be dangerously easy to copy anecdotes of unlucky entrepeneurs
</li><li>
Opensource man!
</li><li>
Have you ever used a linux packagemanager lately?
</li><li>
Have you ever installed opensource webpackages lately?
</li><li>
Things are improving!
</li>
</ul>
<p>For some reason, nontech people (see quote) like to promote nice catchphrases which are based on outdated situations. </p>
<h3>What changed </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Opensource software usually breaks"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, any software can break. Opensource software comes in many ways and forms, unsupported, supported, professionals, hobbyistic etc. It says more about the person choosing the opensource software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why would you risk running into problems, which require you to contact some hobbyist programmer in Russia, who maybe already passed away?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it says more about the person choosing the opensource software. These days, the testing- and building-trends of software are heavily improving compared to years ago. Imho, also standards like git, svn and buildsystems heavily raised the quality of building/upgrading/installing opensource packages.</p>
<h3>Can a SaaS company debunk SaaS? </h3>
<p>Why should a SaaS company use utilities 'in the cloud' only? Lets have a nonbiased observation on SaaS benefits:</p>
<h3>High Adoption </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SaaS applications are available from any computer or any device—any time, anywhere. Because most people are familiar with using the Internet to find what they need, SaaS apps tend to have high adoption rates, with a lower learning curve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, although many webprojects are built using (f)bootstrap(p) these days, which offer a quite responsive crossdevice webexperience. More and more opensource ready-to-use-applications adopt these interfaces, which makes it peanuts to roll out your own application on a server.</p>
<h3>Lower Initial Costs </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SaaS applications are subscription based. No license fees mean lower initial costs. Having the SaaS provider manage the IT infrastructure means lower IT costs for hardware, software, and the people needed to manage it all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Partly true. It is true if a company insists on using proprietary software only, even for internal tools (not so clever these days). SaaS usually uses opensource software (with no- or copyleft licenses), but marketing usually tries to that. Instead, they compare their SaaS service to a world of proprietary software, (with copyright licenses).</p>
<h3>Painless Upgrades </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>No more licenses, no more exceptional costs, no aggresive vendor-lockin, the bigger the userbase becomes, the more the need for upgrades occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly true. It is true if you want to integrate the software in your businessmodel for endusers. (For example, most of the websites run on Apache Webserver, an opensource softwarepackage. The webapplication which apache serves, could require painfull upgrades. So it depends totally on the purpose.</p>
<h3>Seamless Integration </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SaaS vendors with true multitenant architectures can scale indefinitely to meet customer demand. Many SaaS providers also offer customization capabilities to meet specific needs. Plus, many provide APIs that let you integrate with existing ERP systems or other business productivity systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly true, it doesnt garantue anything when things get done.  Ofcoarse when paying a premium fee, things will be done faster, but if your working with investors and tight deadlines it can be more safe to do things inhouse. Also, the standards nowadays are rich: APIs (oAuth/google/facebook/dropbox/etc), RSS, JSON and other standards enable developers to connect to 3rd parties in no time.</p>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>Eat vegetables and brush your teeth everyday, and don't believe everybody. There are many ways of doing many things, especially if you are a SaaS company and you can not afford to rely on other people's business. Every businessmodel is different.</p>
