<h3>Statement </h3>
<p><em>Developing native apps which are only informative is usually a waste of money</em></p>
<h3>What are native apps </h3>
<p>Native apps are apps made for a particular platform (as in <code>android</code> or <code>iOS</code>). They need a particular programmer which has experience with that particular platform.</p>
<h3>Benefits native apps </h3>
<ul>
<li>
great for on-the-edge technology
</li><li>
fastest computing speed
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are informative apps? </h3>
<p>Apps which just do basic stuff like displaying information, pictures, sounds and video.</p>
<h3>What are webapps? </h3>
<p>Webapps are basically HTML5/Webkit-applications which are supported by all major smartphone/tabletdevices.</p>
<h3>Advantages of webapps over native apps </h3>
<ul>
<li>
write once, run on all platforms (android/iphone/tablet/younameit)
</li><li>
need no approval from third parties (<code>appstore etc</code>)
</li><li>
therefore transparent deadlines
</li><li>
therefore faster developmenttime than native apps
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Authors experience </h3>
<p>I did several projects, and I'm quite enthousiast about this webapps-movement. Eventhough its pretty new, I already had quite some satisfied customers.</p>

<h3>Why do I think its the bomb? </h3>
<ul>
<li>
runs on ALL mobile platforms (iphone/android/etc)
</li><li>
faster development then native apps
</li><li>
your app is never going to be rejected by applestore, this happens very often
</li><li>
more control regarding deadlines
</li><li>
faster development, you can update without getting approval
</li><li>
cheaper then native app (which starts around 15.000$)
</li><li>
step by step marketing: first webapp, then maybe app later
</li>
</ul>
<h3>You have been warned </h3>
<p>As you might have noticed, webapps are <b>NOT</b> native apps, and are <b>NOT</b> submitted to any (apple) store. Because of that, you have to consider the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
needs extra packaging to submit to (apple)store (if this is part of your business plan)
</li><li>
partially support for specific phone-features (soon camera/3d hardwareacceleration will come though)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other then that, its the next step since the applestore's restrictions are getting more and more strict (because of the growing amount of apps).</p>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>Mobile webapps is what you should look for in the 1st place nowadays!</p>
