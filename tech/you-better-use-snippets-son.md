===========================

### Problem ###

Writing good commented, conventional code is like flossing, everybody agrees, not everybody does it.

### Why ###

Lack of time, lazyness, excuses, stress.

### The real problem ###

Limiting oneself to a particular codingstyle should not be a human effort, but a logical result.

### Solution ###

Sit down once with yourself and build your own snippet-library.

### How ###

Every editor offers many way of implementing/triggering snippets.
So when you hit one shortcut, it will insert a snippet (piece of text).

### Demo ###

<br><div><script id="playterm-MjAxMS0wNS92aW1zbmlwcGV0dHR5LTEzMDQ0NDk3NDJ8" type="text/javascript" src="http://playterm.org/js/?hash=MjAxMS0wNS92aW1zbmlwcGV0dHR5LTEzMDQ0NDk3NDJ8" class="size:"></script></div><br>

### Conclusion ###

No excuse to write bad code.
