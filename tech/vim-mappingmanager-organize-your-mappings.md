Vim mappingmanager
==================

### Problem ###

You have zillion of plugins, zillion of shortcuts which are impossible to remember.

### Solution ###

Use always the same shortcuts, but with different mappings.

### How it works ###

Basically we use the F1-F12 keys, but can use them with different presets (which we can change on the fly). Everything can be defined in a global configuration mappingfile, but also per project- or user.

### Commands ###

  * use ,m to toggle a mappingmanager-panel which gives LOT of info 
  * use ,, to cycle thru mappings (remembering this shortcut is enough, rest is self-explanatory) 
  * [optional] use ,. to view the current mapping 
  * [optional] use ,/ to select a mapping 
  * [optional] use ,m change output mode between 'dialog' or 'console' 
  * [optional] use ,F1 select mapping #1 
  * [optional] use ,F2 select mapping #2
