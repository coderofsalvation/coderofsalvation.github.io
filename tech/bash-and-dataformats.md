Bash and data- / text-formats
=============================

### Problem ###

I wish there was a textformat which enables me to share data between many programminglanguages *including* bash.
Bash is a swiss army knife which can bridge many gaps between different worlds, so how to bridge dataformats?

### Why ###

Because it would be nice if bash could also work with data generated by other programminglanguages.
Usually these generate json,xml e.g. 

### Solution ###

The good old csv- xml- and json- format!
Its easy to write, easy to read, easy to process (if you are lucky). 
Sit down, take a breath, and look at this snippets (ordered from portable to less portable):

<style type="text/css">.gist { width: 523px; }</style>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/coderofsalvation/6120678.js"></script>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/coderofsalvation/48bade85bc09dd9e7ffd.js"></script>
<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/coderofsalvation/6120853.js"></script>

Simple isnt it?

### Conclusion ###

No excuse anymore to invent your own dataformat in bash every time, the snippets above might not 
be perfect, but they can be modified to do the job easily.
