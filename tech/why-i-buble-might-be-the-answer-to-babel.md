Buble the fast/minimal babel alternative 
========================================

    [09:32:36] Finished 'scripts' after 1.7 s

This is what babel gave for compiling some es2015/es6 code.

### Why does this matter ?

* probably runs better on embedded devices
* downloads 4MB dependencies instead of the huge babel-empire 
* it's fast & drop-in-ish
* I don't care about es6-spec politics, buble seems to get this
